00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.900
My heart is moving

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.060
Even when I just walk along the path

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:29.400
I’m here again, right next to you

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.700
In my fearful heart

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.420
White snow falls

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.880
So I’m still, I’m here and I’ll be there

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:51.120
Leaning on your warm shoulder

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:01.400
I feel you again

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.720
I’m still and I’m here

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.100
Let me take you in like this

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.400
So even when we push each other away

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.760
We’ll be engraved even deeper

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.280
Here and there

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.320
Even if we’re under different skies

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.940
I remember your heart

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.560
and I’m still, I’m here

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.660
In my shaking heart

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.800
You came to me again

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:51.060
So I’m still, I’m here and I’ll be there

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.420
Past this frozen path

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.700
I’ve met you again

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.380
I’m still and I’m here

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.380
I don’t wanna lose you again

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.820
Even if you keep pushing me away

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.260
Even if you disappear from my eyes

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.600
Here, I’m here

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.580
I’ll always be next to you

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.400
My heart is moving

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.980
and I’m still, I’m here

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:47.060
In case your memories get erased

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.420
I’m engraving them in my heart

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.560
I’m afraid of time, afraid of not seeing you again

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:10.240
So I’m looking for you again

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.060
I’m still and I’m here

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.000
I don’t wanna lose you again

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.520
Wherever you are in the world

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.580
Wherever you are, I’ll find you

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.280
Here, I’m here

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.120
I’ll always be next to you

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.820
My heart is moving

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:46.080
and I’m still, I’m here

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.180
