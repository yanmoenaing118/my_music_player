00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.040
If I turn back time

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.780
Will the memories be erased?

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.760
I know I’m saying things that
can't be done

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.980
But I made your life difficult

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.260
I had you living in tears

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.520
Guilt made me think that way

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.580
But, for me

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.100
I can’t live outside of you

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.660
Only time coloured by you
will flow pass

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.240
I love you, thank you

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.320
For holding me so warmly

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.660
Because of this love, I manage to live on

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.880
I guess love is like that

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.980
No matter what you say

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.760
It didn't feel like my heart was filled

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.980
I thought maybe I was just being greedy

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.540
These feelings still won't go away easily

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.660
Don't you know?
For me

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.100
I can’t live outside of you

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.900
Only time coloured by you
will flow pass

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.540
I love you, thank you

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.340
For holding me so warmly

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.460
Because of this love, I manage to live

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.800
If I go back in time,
will I be able to endure it?

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.500
All those harsh times

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.780
When I see you, who wasn't shaken

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.420
My lips tremble

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.300
Don't you know?
For me

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.000
I can’t live outside of you

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.580
Only time coloured by you
will flow pass

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.240
I love you, thank you

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.540
For holding me so warmly

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.140
Because of this love, I manage to live

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:27.360
Because of this love, I manage to live
