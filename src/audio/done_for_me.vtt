00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.040
I will erase all the memories that I left for you

2
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:30.280
I hope so I can't remember you

3
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.920
I can't approach you anymore

4
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.280
My heart is scared with this feeling

5
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.960
Take all your memories, I want to erase all of them

6
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.400
Done for me

7
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.560
Can I delete it completely?

8
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.520
Can I get out of you?

9
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.920
Can I erase all the memories of my love?

10
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.800
It can't happen anymore

11
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.800
I can't get any closer

12
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.520
I run like carzy

13
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.200
Go to place that without you

14
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.640
Love has faded away and the memory that remaining were painful

15
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.080
The memory that you left me became a thorn

16
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.820
I want everything to disappear

17
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.920
I want it all erased

18
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.620
Please you let me left so I can rest

19
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:33.660
I can't leave because I know it's you

20
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:40.920
I'll throw away all my memories with you

21
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.520
I can't approach you anymore

22
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.000
My heart is scared with this feeling

23
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.720
Take all your memories, I want to erase all of them

24
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.320
Done for me

25
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.760
Get away from my memory

26
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.880
Take all of your memories too

27
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:23.200
please erase it all even your longing

28
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.800
I won't miss you anymore

29
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.160
I'll forget every moment and everything

30
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.200
Even your little trace

31
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.280
I will erase all the memories that I left for you

32
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.480
I hope so I can't remember you

33
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.120
I can't approach you anymore

34
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.640
I'm so afraid with this feeling

35
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.200
I want to erase everyting

36
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.280
Done for me

37
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.960
I have no choice but to leave you

38
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.360
Because we're gonna have to go away

39
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.840
Please forgive me

40
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.440

41
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.000
