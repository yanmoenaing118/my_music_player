You don"t have to say it but i know

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.300
There"s only one person in you

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.240
And that"s me

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.700
In case you notice my trembling heart

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.600
I couldn't event breath loudly

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.180
That was me

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.100
I had so much fear, I only hid

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.880
But when you call out my love

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.100
I will have courage and look

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.280
On a frozen flower petal

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.680
I will place you

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.320
In the blowing wind

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.500
On the day you come to me

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:21.800
So you won"t just pass me by

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.400
I"m only looking at you

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.580
Without anyone knowing,it grew

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.540
In case you noticed

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.480
I was so nervous

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.900
I had so much fear i only hid

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.960
But when you call out my love

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.560
On a frozen flower petal

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.740
I will place you

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.220
In the blowing wind

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.800
On the day you come to me

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.160
So you wont just pass me by i will pray

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.900
I wont hesitate anymore

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.820
If it's you. i can go anywhere

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.620
The person who believed in me, though i lacked

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.980
I will protect this love next to you

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.880
When my love calls out to you

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.060
Will you have courage?

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.060
When my love calls out to you
Will you have courage?

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.160
