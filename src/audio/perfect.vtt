00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:12.800
I found a love for me

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.300
Darling, dive right in

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.300
And follow my lead

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.800
Well I found a boy

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.800
Beautiful and sweet

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.800
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.800
Cause we were just kids when we fell in love

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.800
Not knowing what it was

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.800
I will not give you up this time

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.800
But darling, just kiss me slow

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:05.800
Your heart is all I own and in your eyes you're holding mine

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.800
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:23.800
Barefoot on the grass listening to our favourite song

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.800
When you said you looked a mess I whispered under my breath

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:38.800
But you heard it darling you look perfect tonight

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:52.800
Well I found a man stronger than anyone I know

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.800
He shares my dreams I hope that someday I'll share his home

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.800
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.000
To carry love to carry children of our own

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
we are still kids and we're so in love

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Fighting against all odds i know we'll be alright this time

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Darling just hold my hand be your girl, you'll be my man

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I see my future in your eyes

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
with you between my arms barefoot on the grass

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.500
Listening to our favourite song

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.500
I have faith in what I see now I know I have met

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:16.500
An angel in person and he looks perfect

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.500
I don't deserve this

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.500
You look perfect tonight

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.500
