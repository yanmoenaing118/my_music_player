00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.863
General's Lady

00:00:18.294 --> 00:00:21.599
The wind speaks with your tone

00:00:21.673 --> 00:00:24.678
Talking about the rain falling in the rain

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:28.625
I pause in the dream

00:00:29.141 --> 00:00:31.930
Counting the years of memory

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.154
Waiting for the passionate love

00:00:35.554 --> 00:00:39.180
I'd trade a lifetime of prosperity for a life of suffering

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.144
Drink a bottle of wine and seat up the story

00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:50.505
Love is the residual warmth of the world

00:00:50.663 --> 00:00:54.173
The flowers bloom and fall leaving traces behind

00:00:54.352 --> 00:00:57.216
Keep the innocence in the passing years

00:00:57.216 --> 00:01:00.495
Only for you

00:01:01.537 --> 00:01:05.058
Love is the first spring in the wilderness

00:01:05.437 --> 00:01:09.010
Quietly open my heart

00:01:09.437 --> 00:01:11.369
No matter what happens

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.306
I'll always be loyal to you

00:01:35.683 --> 00:01:38.848
The palm print in the hand

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:42.784
It messes with the thoughts

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.360
The endless gaze

00:01:46.444 --> 00:01:49.349
In every morning and evening

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.000
Finding peace amidst the chaos

00:01:53.523 --> 00:01:56.961
Happiness and sadness, even If it's only for a moment

00:01:57.287 --> 00:02:03.592
Leave it to the moon and tell the story

00:02:04.536 --> 00:02:07.831
Love is the residual warmth of the world

00:02:08.326 --> 00:02:11.631
The flowers bloom and fall leaving trace behind

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:14.636
Keep the innocence in the passing years

00:02:14.636 --> 00:02:17.798
Only for you

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:22.669
Love is the first spring in the wilderness

00:02:22.858 --> 00:02:26.599
Quietly open my heart

00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:28.636
No matter what happens

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:33.503
I'll always be loyal to you

00:02:34.292 --> 00:02:37.332
Love is the residual warmth of the world

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:40.974
The flowers bloom and fall leaving traces behind

00:02:41.258 --> 00:02:44.369
Keep the innocence in the passing years

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:48.221
Only for you

00:02:48.737 --> 00:02:52.113
Love is the first spring in the wilderness

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.863
Quietly open my heart

00:02:56.463 --> 00:02:58.472
No matter what happens

00:02:58.472 --> 00:03:02.187
I'll always be loyal to you
