00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.700
Explore, the universe

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.380
The sword brings forth the sandstorm

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.140
Comprehending the mortal's view through the sword's sheath

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.620
Ask, for the path through the maze

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.120
Crossing the distance of heaven and earth

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.840
Ruling over every single thing and creature

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.140
My tears, as clear as coloured glass

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.460
Mercy, taking arms preparing for war

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.460
Stabilising the earth, the flood dragon enters the land

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.920
Don't test me, enemies will not forgiven

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.854
Just look at this path, overcome resentment,

00:01:13.854 --> 00:01:17.425
creation, nirvana, for multiple cycles of reincarnation

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.341
Borrowing a few lives of joy and sorrow to refine my heart,

00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:22.760
my courage, my love, I'll do it with no regrets

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.853
There are numerous love tribulations, struggling against the three worlds,

00:01:24.853 --> 00:01:28.320
six paths, nine heavens, for a promise of till death do us apart

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:36.160
Even if I drank from the river of forgetfulness, I will not forget our promise

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.700
My soul, the core of my human body

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.160
All living things are foolish about separating and reuniting

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.120
One thought, a distance of heaven and earth

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.140
Experiencing karma, tasting penetrating pain

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.809
Just look at this path

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:26.740
overcoming resentment, creation, nirvana, for multiple cycles of reincarnation

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.139
Borrowing a few lives of sorrow and joy to refine my heart,

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.800
my courage, my love, I'll do it with no regrets

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.740
There are numerous love tribulations, struggling against the three worlds,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.540
six paths, nine heavens, for a promise of till death do us apart

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.200
Even if I drank from the river of forgetfulness, I will not forget our promise

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.040
Blood ties, no boundary between good and evil

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.640
Yin and Yang, mutual restrain

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.620
Emptiness, a choice in the midst of obsessions

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:13.740
Choose what's good and not heaven's will
